R and Python scripts that I used for experimenting with classification of soil layers with ML

See https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-geotechnical-profiles-rob-van-putten/ for more information about the initial code, the gef-files and the bbgeolib Python package.

See 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interpretable-machine-learning-geotechnical-profiles-nynke-ter-heide/' for an explantion of the R and Python scripts in this repository.

Feedback, questions and suggestions are welcome!
